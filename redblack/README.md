redblack puzzle
=================

This is an automated framework for developing and testing solutions to
the red/black puzzle. The puzzle is as follows:

You are given a randomly shuffled deck of 52 cards, half of which are
red and half of which are black. Before each card is flipped over, you
must choose whether to bet on that card or not. If you do bet on that
card, then you win if it is red and lose if it is black. If you don't
bet on that card then play continues. You cannot pass on the final
card; you have to bet. ONCE YOU BET ON A CARD, WIN OR LOSE, THE DECK
RESHUFFLES. The goal is to find the optimal strategy of when to bet
that yields the highest win percentage over an arbitrarily large
number of plays.
