hundred_prisoners
=================

If you think you have a solution to the 100 prisoners puzzle, implement
it rigorously and see if it actually works!

For those not in the know, a formulation of the puzzle can be seen here:
http://tierneylab.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/23/the-puzzle-of-100-hats/

The one difference between that version and the one this implements is
that, for ease of development, the "colors" on the hats are True and False
instead of red or blue.

I've provided a framework that handles the bookkeeping of the puzzle;
all that's left for you to do is implement the logic that an individual
uses to decide whether he thinks his hat is True or False.  You have
all the information you need to solve the puzzle available, so if you
kill more than one prisoner, his death is on your hands.

Have at it!
